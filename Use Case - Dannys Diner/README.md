## Question and Solution


### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m
WHERE
    s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
```

### Output

| customer_id |total_spent |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           |76            |
| B           |74            |
| C           |36            |

#### Output: 

Customer A spent $76, B spent $74, and C spent $36.

### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
```sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN mem.join_date AND DATE_ADD(mem.join_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY) 
                THEN m.price * 20  
            ELSE 
                m.price * 10  
        END
    ) AS total_points 
FROM 
    sales s
JOIN 
    members mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
JOIN 
    menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE 
    s.order_date <= '2021-01-31'  -- Filter to end of January
GROUP BY 
    s.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    s.customer_id;
```
