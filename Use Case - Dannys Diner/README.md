## Question and Solution


### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m
WHERE
    s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
```

### Output

| customer_id |total_spent |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           |76            |
| B           |74            |
