## Question and Solution
Please join me in executing the queries using PostgreSQL on DB Fiddle. It would be great to work together on the questions! 

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
