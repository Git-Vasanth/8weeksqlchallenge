    s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM
    sales s
        JOIN
    menu m
WHERE
    s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
```

### Output

| customer_id |total_spent |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           |76            |

  s.customer_id AS customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.order_date) AS visitng_count
FROM 
  dannys_diner.sales AS s
GROUP BY 
  s.customer_id
ORDER BY 
  s.customer_id ASC;

```
### Output

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
```sql
with ranks as (select customer_id , order_date , product_id , row_number() Over(partition by customer_id order by order_date) as roow_number from sales)

select r.customer_id , r.order_date , r.product_id , m.product_name from ranks r
join menu m
on r.product_id = m.product_id
where r.roow_number = 1
;

```

### Output

| customer_id |order_date | product_id |product_count |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|

```sql
with max_order as (select s.customer_id , s.product_id , m.product_name from sales s
join
menu m 
on 
s.product_id = m.product_id)

select product_name , count(product_name) as ordered_count from max_order group by product_name order by ordered_count desc limit 1
;

```

### Output

| product_name |ordered_count |
|-------------|--------------|
| ramen           |8            |

```sql
with ranked_table as (select customer_id ,  product_id , count(product_id)  as count_orders, rank() over(partition by customer_id order by count(product_id) desc) as ranked_orders from sales s group by customer_id ,  product_id) 

select rt.customer_id , rt.product_id , m.product_name , rt.count_orders from ranked_table rt
join menu m

rt.product_id = m.product_id
where rt.ranked_orders = 1
order by customer_id
